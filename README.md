# DevClub Summer of Code 2024: Frontend Development Track

Welcome to the **Frontend Development** track of the DevClub Summer of Code 2024! This track focuses on building a **Point of Sale (POS) System** for a newly inaugurated retail store at SDA Market, Hauz Khas. Over the next five weeks, you will dive into the world of frontend development, learning various technologies and skills to create a functional and user-friendly POS system.

## Overview of Frontend Development

Frontend development involves creating the visual and interactive aspects of a website or web application. As a frontend developer, you will work on building the user interface (UI) and ensuring a seamless user experience (UX). Key technologies and concepts in frontend development include:

- **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)**: The standard markup language for creating web pages.
- **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)**: Used to style and layout web pages.
- **JavaScript**: A programming language that enables dynamic content and interactive features.
- **Frontend Frameworks and Libraries**: Tools like React, Vue.js, or Angular that help in building complex and efficient web applications.
- **State Management**: Techniques and libraries like Redux or Vuex to manage the state of your application.
- **API Integration**: Connecting your frontend with backend services to fetch and display data.

### Importance of Frontend Development

Frontend development is crucial because it is the layer of software that users interact with directly. A well-designed frontend ensures that users can navigate and use an application easily and effectively. Good frontend development results in a positive user experience, which can lead to increased user satisfaction and engagement. In the context of a POS system, an intuitive and efficient frontend can significantly enhance the productivity of store staff and improve customer service.

## Components to be Built in the Frontend Vertical

The POS system will consist of three main portals, each catering to different user roles within the retail store:

### 1. Admin Portal for Stock and Inventory Management
- **Purpose**: To enable the admin to manage the store's stock and inventory.
- **Features**:
  - **Dashboard**: Overview of stock levels, recent orders, and alerts for low inventory.
  - **Stock Management**: Add, update, or remove products from the inventory.
  - **Inventory Tracking**: Monitor stock levels and track inventory changes over time.
  - **Reports**: Generate reports on inventory status and product performance.

### 2. Cashier Portal for Customer Interaction
- **Purpose**: To facilitate cashiers in handling customer transactions efficiently.
- **Features**:
  - **Login**: Secure login for cashiers to access the portal.
  - **Customer Details Input**: Enter and manage customer information.
  - **Cart Management**: Add or remove items from the customer's cart.
  - **Checkout Process**: Process payments and generate bills for customers.
  - **Transaction History**: View past transactions and issue receipts as pdf.

### 3. Admin-Only Portal for Monitoring Sales
- **Purpose**: To provide the admin with insights into sales performance and help optimize sales strategies.
- **Features**:
  - **Sales Dashboard**: Visual representation of sales data, including graphs and charts.
  - **Sales Monitoring**: Track daily, weekly, and monthly sales performance.
  - **Data Analysis**: Analyze sales trends and identify patterns to optimize inventory and sales strategies.

## Conclusion

By the end of this 5-week journey, you will have a comprehensive understanding of frontend development and a complete POS system that includes an admin portal for stock and inventory management, a cashier portal for handling customer transactions, and an admin-only portal for monitoring and analyzing sales data. This project will equip you with the skills needed to build real-world applications and tackle various frontend challenges.

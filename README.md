## Aim
We aim to help students get started with learning coding and software development. The concepts for each [track](#the-tracks) are divided into **weeks** pedagogically so you can learn step-by-step.

No matter if you're a beginner or an expert, at each stage, you will be learning something new, and building something **useful** in real world. You will also be equipped with the skills and tools which would meet **most tech requirements**, and the final projects in each track will be good enough to be put in your **portfolio or CV**.

We are keeping the repository open to **everyone from around the world**, so everyone can use it to learn and share their ideas in the forks.
